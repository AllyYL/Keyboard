Keyboard is the New Sexy 

Keyboard is the New Sexy is one of the mini-sites under She Raged where users type down words censored by major social media and image search platforms to a blank canvas, such as “nudes” and “nipples”, to reveal images of female nudes randomly fetched from the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s APIs -- the only forms of female nudity that are deemed to be “legitimate.” 

Do we have to be either a muse or a slut?
